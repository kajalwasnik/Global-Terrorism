# Global-Terrorism

This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), a comprehensive dataset covering domestic and international terrorist attacks globally from 1970 to 2017. Developed and maintained by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland, the database records over 180,000 terrorist incidents. The project aims to uncover significant trends and patterns in terrorism-related activities through in-depth analysis and visualizations using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The exploration seeks insights into attack frequency, targeted countries, methods, weapons, casualties, and the evolution of terrorist organizations.

By delving into these factors, the project aims to provide a detailed overview of global terrorism trends, informing counter-terrorism strategies and policies. The findings may also enhance understanding of regions prone to attacks and reasons for vulnerability. In conclusion, this data-driven exploration aims to reveal hidden patterns in the GTD, contributing valuable insights to counter-terrorism efforts and future research. The project combines data manipulation, numerical computation, and graphic visualization for a comprehensive exploration of the dataset and significant key findings in global terrorism.
